    ## Output Format
    
    The result should be formatted in **JSON** dictionary and enclosed in **triple backticks (\` \`\`\` \` )**  without labels like "json", "css", or "data".
    - **Do not** generate redundant content other than the result in JSON format.
    - **Do not** use triple backticks anywhere else in your answer.
    - The JSON must include keys: 
        - "text_response" :  a JSON string for the response to the user in chat.
        - "actions" : whose value is a list of command dictionaries, and each command dictionary must include: 
            - "name" : the command name, one of the following supported commands
            - "params" : a dictionary of parameters for the command, with parameter names as keys and parameter values as values. If no parameters, use an empty dictionary {}.
    
    Following is an example of the output: 
    
    \`\`\`
    {
        "text_response" : "No problem, the overview of all bots will be available once the action are finished.",
        "actions" : [
            {
                "name": "!doSomeAction",
                "params": {}
            }
        ]
    }
    \`\`\`
    `
